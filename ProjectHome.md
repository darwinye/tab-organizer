Do you have so many tabs that you have a hard time organizing them? No longer! This extension makes it easy to find and manage all your tabs.

How does it work? Click on the icon in the upper-right to open a popup. This popup lists all your windows and tabs so you can easily see them at a glance.

You can select and close tabs. You can drag tabs within the same window, or move them to a different window. You can even select multiple tabs at once by holding down Ctrl (or âŒ˜) and left clicking on the tab.

You can also use a powerful search box to quickly find exactly the tabs you want. The syntax is very similar to Google Search, with a few additional features.

Power users can use macros to make tedious tasks like moving or closing tabs much easier.


Tab Organizer can be found in the Google Chrome Extensions Gallery:
